## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Backend App Initialization Error

**Issue:**  
File: `backend/app.py` (Last line)  
The Flask app was being instantiated twice - once inside the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block and once outside of it at the module level without proper conditional.

**Original Code:**
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    env = os.getenv('FLASK_ENV', 'development')
    app = create_app(env)
    # ... rest of code ...
    else:
        app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
# This line below would always execute when imported by Gunicorn
app = create_app(os.getenv("FLASK_ENV", "production"))
```

**Problem:**  
- Duplicate app creation could cause initialization conflicts
- The unconditional `app = create_app()` at the end would create an extra app instance every time the module was imported
- Could cause database initialization issues

**Fix Applied:**
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    env = os.getenv('FLASK_ENV', 'development')
    app = create_app(env)
    
    if env == "development":
        with app.app_context():
            db.create_all()
            ensure_user_columns(app)
            # ... logging ...
    
    if env == 'production':
        # For production, gunicorn will handle this
        pass
    else:
        app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
else:
    # Expose app for Gunicorn (production)
    app = create_app(os.getenv("FLASK_ENV", "production"))
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Backend now starts without errors
- ✅ Proper app initialization for both development and production
- ✅ Gunicorn will properly find the `app` object when imported
- ✅ Database migration runs correctly
